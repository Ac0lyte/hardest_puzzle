I recently bought a puzzle at a yard sale that advertised itself as the hardest puzzle in the world. It was nine pieces, all square with two protruding shapes and two sockets. Each protrusion or socket were one of four shapes. The shapes were Heart, Spade, Diamond, and Club. After a few minutes I realized that I would spend many frustrating hours on this, so I decided to script it. 

I am also attempting to learn a bit about python, so I thought it would be a good time to do so.
